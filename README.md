# git-source-control
 Server-side source control extension for Git on InterSystems' platforms

## Prerequisites/Dependencies

* IRIS instance with license key
* Git 2.31.0+
* OpenSSH 7.6+
* InterSystems package manager (https://openexchange.intersystems.com/package/ObjectScript-Package-Manager)

## Installation and Setup
---

1. Load this repository into IRIS from the community package registry. 
    ```
    zpm "install git-source-control"
    ```
2. Configure settings by running the following method and answering the prompts:
   ```
   d ##class(SourceControl.Git.API).Configure()
   ```
3. If using VSCode: Set up `isfs` server-side editing. First, save your current workspace in which you have the code open. Then, open the `.code-workspace` file generated by VS Code and add the following to the list of folders: 
    ```
    {
        "name": "<whatever you want the folder to show up as in the project explorer view>",
        "uri": "isfs://<instance_name>:<namespace_name>/"
    }
    ```

## Basic Use

### Studio
Add a file for tracking by right clicking on it in the workspace/project view and choosing Git &gt; Add.
This same menu also has options to remove (stop tracking the file), discard changes (revert to the index), or commit changes.

You can browse file history and commit changes through a user interface launched from the top level Git > "Launch Git UI" menu item. There is also a page for configuring settings.

### VSCode
The same right click menus as in Studio live under "Server Source Control..." when right clicking in a file (in the editor) or on a file when exploring an isfs folder. The top level "source control" menu is accessible through the command palette or the source control icon in the top right of the editor.

## Notes

### Security
If you want to interact with remotes from VSCode/Studio directly (e.g., to push/pull), you must use ssh (rather than https), create a public/private key pair to identify the instance (not yourself), configure the private key file for use in Settings, and configure the public key as a deploy key in the remote(s).

### `sc-list.txt`
The `sc-list.txt` file is used to keep track of files that exist on the filesystem and the server. It is used to determine which files need to be exported from the filesystem or imported into the server. As such, it must be tracked by Git and synced properly to ensure consistent extension behavior across all the distributed repositories. To simplify this, when  `sc-list.txt` is updated, any changes to it are automatically staged and will be committed in the next commit barring any manual intervention. 

## During Development

:warning: Whenever any code in this project is updated outside of the server (e.g. after every `git pull`), you _have_ to run `zpm "load <absolute path to git-source-control>"`. Otherwise the changes won't be reflected on the server. However, if you load git-source-control via the InterSystems package manager and run `git pull` via the extension itself with the default pull event handler configured, it'll just work.
